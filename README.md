### What is an ECG?
    An Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart. It records the heart's rhythm and electrical signals, helping detect various heart conditions.

    ### How This App Works
    This app uses a machine learning model trained to classify different types of heartbeats based on ECG data. It first processes the input data, performs feature scaling, and then applies a trained model to predict the type of heartbeat.

    ### Types of Heartbeats Classified
    1. **Normal Beat**: A healthy heartbeat.
    2. **Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC)**: An early beat originating from the ventricles.
    3. **Unclassified beat'**
    4. **Supraventricular premature or ectopic beat**
    5. **Fusion of ventricular and normal beat**
